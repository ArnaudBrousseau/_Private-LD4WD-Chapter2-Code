Changelog: 
----------

- Moved initial comment below the Doctype
- Created separate script "nose.js" file to clear the HTML
- Moved script to the end of the file -- just before the closing </body> tag
- Modified the log() function to work and added some styling to it

ToDoS : 
-------

- Implementation for a simple use case -- the one described in the chapter, i.e: 
  Fetching from Freebase for a movie entity > Searching for the Soundtrack > requesting MusicBrainz to retrieve the Soundtrack info
- Explore different nose-following paths...   
- Find a good & reliable source of information. 
  It seems it's kind of a unicorn at the moment. Solution: use YQL to aggregate several sources of information?
  + idea: use the YQL Jquery plugin? ()
